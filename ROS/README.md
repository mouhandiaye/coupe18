# Installation

Once the repo is cloned, run `catkin_make` inside this directory from a terminal to
generate the `build/` and `devel/` ROS folders.

You must then source the workspace with `source devel/setup.bash` or `source devel/setup.zsh` each
time you open a new terminal. Adding this line to your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc` (with the full
path to the setup file) will simply automate this step.
